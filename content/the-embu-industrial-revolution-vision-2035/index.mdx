# The Embu Industrial Revolution - Vision 2035

**Vision 2035 is not just about me or my team building 100 factories in Embu by 2035. It is about transforming the mindset of our business community, encouraging smarter investments that create jobs and drive sustainable economic growth.**

## Rethinking Investment Strategies

Many investors in Embu focus on **real estate**, often opting to build **apartment complexes** with significant capital investments. While real estate can be profitable, we must ask ourselves: **Is this the best way to create economic impact and job opportunities for our youth?**

Let’s take a **real-world example:**

- If an investor spends **KES 40 million** to build a **five-story apartment** in **Majimbo**, they may earn **KES 300,000 per month** in rental income.
- However, the project will likely create **only one permanent job**—a caretaker.

Now, consider an **alternative investment approach**:

- The same **KES 40 million** could be used to establish a **Ngunia (woven sack) manufacturing factory** in **Kivwe**.
- This factory would generate over **300 job opportunities** for the local youth.
- The factory’s monthly revenue potential could exceed **KES 4 million**.

### The Impact of Smart Investments

Investing in **industrial development** rather than just real estate leads to:

1. **Massive Job Creation** – Factories and production facilities employ hundreds of workers, reducing unemployment rates.
2. **Higher Returns for Investors** – Industries have the potential to generate **higher revenue and profits** compared to rental apartments.
3. **Economic Growth** – A thriving industrial sector attracts more businesses, suppliers, and infrastructure development.
4. **Empowering Local Communities** – More jobs mean **increased disposable income**, boosting local businesses and service providers.

## Achieving the Vision: Steps Forward

For Vision 2035 to become a reality, we need a **collective shift in investment priorities**. Here’s how we can achieve this:

1. **Encourage Private Investors** – Investors should be educated on the benefits of industrial projects over traditional real estate investments.
2. **Government and Policy Support** – The county government must offer incentives such as tax breaks and infrastructure support for industrial development.
3. **Capacity Building** – Training programs should equip the youth with skills needed in manufacturing and industrial jobs.
4. **Strategic Partnerships** – Collaboration between investors, government agencies, and financial institutions can accelerate industrialization efforts.

## Together, We Can Transform Embu

The Embu Industrial Revolution - Vision 2035 is not just a dream—it is a **blueprint for sustainable economic growth**. By shifting our investment mindset, we can create **thousands of jobs**, boost **business profitability**, and uplift **entire communities**.

The time to act is **NOW**. Let us **invest wisely, build industries, and shape a prosperous future for Embu County**.
