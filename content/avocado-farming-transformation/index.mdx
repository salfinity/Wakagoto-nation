# Watu Wangu wa Embu—Tulimeni Avocado 🥑 Please!

We have all agreed that **poverty is our common enemy**, and together, we need to eliminate it. One of the best ways to do this is by tapping into **avocado farming** and supplying our produce to a **state-of-the-art avocado processing factory** right here in Embu. This factory will revolutionize the industry and empower our farmers to earn better incomes.

## The Vision: A World-Class Avocado Factory

Imagine an **avocado processing plant** with a built-in **commercial helipad** to facilitate quick and efficient transportation. This is not just a dream—this is the future we are working towards. Here’s how it will work:

A farmer from **Kathangariri** can harvest their avocados in the morning, and by the afternoon, they are **airlifted to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA)**. The next day at **10:00 AM**, Kenyans living in **Dubai** are enjoying fresh, delicious avocados straight from Embu.

## The Economic Benefits

1. **Better Market Access** – Farmers will no longer struggle with middlemen who exploit them. The factory ensures direct access to export markets.
2. **Job Creation** – The facility will provide employment opportunities for **hundreds of workers** in various roles, from processing to logistics.
3. **Higher Earnings for Farmers** – By eliminating unnecessary intermediaries, farmers will get higher prices per kilogram.
4. **Technological Advancements** – The factory will incorporate the latest **processing, packaging, and transportation technologies**.
