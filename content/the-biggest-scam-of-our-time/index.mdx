# Ewasco is the Biggest Scam of Our Time

It is beyond comprehension how a service provider like **Ewasco** can justify raising a bill of **KES 150,000** for the Wakagoto Foundation for the period between **December 1st to January 15th**—a mere **45 days**. What makes this charge even more concerning is that the foundation **has not yet begun its operations**.

## Unjustifiable Billing and Public Outrage

Ewasco’s billing practices are raising serious concerns across the town. This is not an isolated case; **many residents and businesses are complaining** about outrageous charges that lack transparency and fairness. When a water company starts operating as a profiteering entity rather than a **public service provider**, it loses its legitimacy and the trust of the people it serves.

## The Need for Accountability

For service providers like **Ewasco**, a people-centric approach is critical. This means operating with:

- **Fairness** – Charges should reflect actual usage and be justifiable.
- **Transparency** – Customers deserve to understand how bills are calculated.
- **Responsiveness** – Addressing public concerns instead of dismissing them.

If such mismanagement continues, Ewasco risks **irreparably damaging its reputation**, which could lead to the downfall of the organization itself.

## A Call for Action

It is time for **local leaders, consumer protection agencies, and the public** to hold Ewasco accountable. Unchecked mismanagement will only continue to **hurt innocent consumers and businesses** trying to grow and sustain themselves in an already challenging economic environment.

Ewasco, the people are watching. **It’s time to do better.**
