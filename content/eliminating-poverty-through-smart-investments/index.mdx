# Poverty Is Our Common Enemy – We Must Eliminate It

Poverty remains a major challenge in our communities, but with the right strategies, we can work towards eliminating it. One of the most practical and long-term solutions lies in agricultural investment—specifically, **avocado farming**.

## The Power of Planting Avocado Trees

Imagine this: if on the same day you welcome a child into the world, you also plant **at least 30 avocado trees**, you are securing a **lifelong financial foundation** for that child.

### Understanding the Numbers

A well-nurtured **Hass or Fuerte avocado tree** yields a minimum of **100 kilograms** of fruit per season for the export market. With an average market price of **KES 80 per kilogram**, the financial potential becomes clear:

- **30 trees × 100 kg = 3,000 kg of avocados**
- **3,000 kg × KES 80 = KES 240,000 per season**

With such an income, your child may never have to struggle for bursaries or rely on **HELB loans** to finance their education. This simple act of planting trees today ensures a stable financial future for generations to come.

## The Sustainability and Economic Benefits of Avocado Farming

Aside from the financial benefits, avocado farming also contributes positively to the environment. Trees help in **carbon sequestration**, reducing greenhouse gases and promoting a healthier ecosystem. Moreover, avocados are in high demand in international markets, making them a **stable cash crop** with consistent earnings.

### Additional Benefits of Avocado Farming:

1. **Job Creation** – Encouraging avocado farming in our communities means more employment opportunities in farming, harvesting, packaging, and export logistics.
2. **Soil Conservation** – Trees help prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility, and contribute to sustainable farming practices.
3. **Diversified Income** – Besides avocados, farmers can intercrop with other crops like beans and maize to maximize land use and income streams.

## How to Get Started in Avocado Farming

For those interested in avocado farming, here are some key steps to follow:

1. **Choose the Right Variety** – Hass and Fuerte are the best varieties for the export market.
2. **Get Quality Seedlings** – Source certified seedlings from agricultural extension services or reputable nurseries.
3. **Prepare Your Land** – Ensure proper spacing (5-7 meters apart), well-drained soil, and access to water for irrigation.
4. **Care and Maintenance** – Regular pruning, pest control, and organic fertilizers will improve yield.
5. **Market Your Produce** – Engage with avocado exporters and cooperative societies to ensure you get the best market prices.
