## Support a Homegrown Brand

We encourage all **motorists and boda boda operators** to support this **internationally recognized brand** that is owned by one of our own. It’s not just a fuel station; it’s a symbol of **local success and economic growth**.

🚀 **Fun Fact:** Riva Petrol Station is the **only petrol station in Kenya with a glass canopy roof**! 😇

## Driving the Industrial Revolution

This launch is a significant step towards the **Embu Industrial Revolution – Vision 2035**, an initiative aimed at transforming our local economy and creating more opportunities for our people.

Let’s fuel the future together! ⛽
