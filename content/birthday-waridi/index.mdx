Today is a very special day in my life as I celebrate **12 wonderful years** of fatherhood. Twelve years ago today, you gave me the prestigious title of **PAPA** 😍, and since then, the journey of raising you has been nothing short of fulfilling.

I have watched you grow and mature into the **amazing young girl** you are today—full of wisdom, kindness, and an incredible spirit. You bring so much joy and pride into our lives, and I am beyond grateful to call you my daughter. 💖

Join me in celebrating the birthday of my lovely daughter, **Dr. Waridi Mwaniki**. May your future be as bright as your smile, and may your dreams take you to places beyond imagination! 🎊🥳

**Happy 12th Birthday, Waridi!** 🎈🎁
